<h2> Prisoners </h2>

<div>
    <p style="float: left;"><img src="prison.jpg" width="550" height="400"/></p>
    <p> Director: Denis Villeneuve </p>
    <p> Synopsis: When the police take time to find Keller Dover's daughter and her friend, he decides to go on a search himself. His desperation leads him closer to finding the truth and also jeopardises his own life. </p>
    <p> Personal Review: One of the most chilling thriller movies I have ever seen, "Prisoners" is rich in compelling narratives and stellar performances from the ensemble cast. </p>

<h2> Zodiac </h2>

<div>
    <p style="float: left;"><img src="zod.jpg" width="550" height="400"/></p>
    <p>Director: David Fincher</p>
    <p>Synopsis: Robert Graysmith, a cartoonist by profession, finds himself obsessively thinking about the Zodiac killer. He uses his puzzle-solving abilities to get closer to revealing the identity of the killer. </p>
    <p>Personal Review: One of my top movies of all time.
Fincher has such an eye for detail, and an ability to constantly propel a story forward. This movie weighs in at well over two and a half hours but there's not a single moment wasted, no drifting off into the second act doldrums.</p>

<h2> Green Book </h2>


<div>
    <p style="float: left;"><img src="book.jpg" width="550" height="400"/></p>
    <p>Director: Peter Farrelly</p>
    <p> Synonpsis: Dr Don Shirley is a world-class African-American pianist, who is about to embark on a concert tour in the Deep South in 1962. In need of a driver and protection, Shirley recruits Tony Lip, a tough-talking bouncer from an Italian-American neighbourhood in the Bronx. Despite their differences, the two men soon develop an unexpected bond while confronting racism and danger in an era of segregation.</p>
    <p> Personal Review: Green Book is as smooth as they come, this film covers a lot of things at once and it does it so seamlessly and effortlessly and the credit for that goes to two amazingly talented leads who shape this film to what it is, an affectionate friendship story, considering that this is based on actual real-life story and how hard is to put together something worth telling without slipping to no man's land of storytelling is amazing in and of itself, but this film doesn't stop there it offers a heartwarming story between seemingly opposite men but deep down they're the same.</p>

<h2> Forrest Gump </h2>

<div>
    <p style="float: left;"><img src="gump.jpg" width="550" height="400"/></p>
    <p>Director: Robert Zemeckis</p>
    <p>Synopsis: Forrest, a man with low IQ, recounts the early years of his life when he found himself in the middle of key historical events. All he wants now is to be reunited with his childhood sweetheart, Jenny. </p>
    <p>Personal Review: Tom hanks has done an amazing job to portray this character, I believe he is one of the only Hollywood actors who could of pulled this role off.
Fincher has such an eye for detail, and an ability to constantly propel a story forward. This movie weighs in at well over two and a half hours but there's not a single moment wasted, no drifting off into the second act doldrums.</p>
